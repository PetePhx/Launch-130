Setup the Test Class - Cash Register

Let's start things from the ground up. We want to make a simple test suite for
our CashRegister class. Setup the initial testing file. You don't have to have
any tests in your test file. For this exercise, write everything you would need
to start testing CashRegister, excluding the tests themselves (necessary
requires, test class, etc.).

# cash_register_test.rb

require 'minitest/autorun'
require "minitest/reporters"
Minitest::Reporters.use!

require_relative 'cash_register'
require_relative 'transaction'

class CashRegisterTest < MiniTest::Test
end

In particle physics, asymptotic freedom is a property of some gauge theories 
that causes interactions between particles to become asymptotically weaker as
the energy scale increases and the corresponding length scale decreases.

Asymptotic freedom is a feature of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the quantum
field theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons, the
fundamental constituents of nuclear matter. Quarks interact weakly at high
energies, allowing perturbative calculations. At low energies the interaction
becomes strong, leading to the confinement of quarks and gluons within composite
hadrons.

The asymptotic freedom of QCD was discovered in 1973 by David Gross and Frank
Wilczek,[1] and independently by David Politzer in the same year.[2] For this
work all three shared the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics.[3]
